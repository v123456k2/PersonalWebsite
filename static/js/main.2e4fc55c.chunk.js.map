As a student who is still in the process of \n                  learning technical skills required, this phase is especially crucial for me. I often ponder \n                  what it is about software engineering that draws my interests so intensely. Throughout the \n                  experiences interning at different companies as well as completing different projects, \n                  I have finally found my answer – it is the type of work and the ability to make a difference in \n                  people’s lives. I have had experience with many programming projects and internships during my time \n                  at school, I felt truly intrigued and invigorated when I was coding. \n                </p>\n                <p>I have been involved in many projects and internships. To briefly touch on it, in my previous \n                  FoodShed project I developed an app to monitor fridges around campus in order to reduce food waste, \n                  and in my previous internship I was building a mobile app aimed to reduce crime rate by determining \n                  the safeness of the user based on their location and historical crime records.  \n                  Currently, I am in a research team working on the detection of lung diseases using thoracic images, \n                  allowing for faster detections.\n                </p>\n                <p>My specialties include problem solving, quickly learning new skills, and communicating with others. \n                  So far, I have experiences with Java, Python, C++/C, HTML, CSS, React, SQL, NoSQL, \n                  and I’m enthusiastic to apply them in projects and learn more languages.\n                </p>\n                <br/>\n\n                <h1>Vision Proposition  Statement</h1>\n                <p>This site allows visitors to get to know who I am better, including my interests and backgrounds. \n                  It showcases my past internships and project experiences and the projects I am current working on, \n                  demonstrating my interest in coding and a desire to make the society a better place. \n                  It also displays some of my past technical writing sample and presentation sample, showing in \n                  details some of my past works. \n                </p>\n                <br/>\n\n                <h1>Who am I?</h1>\n                <p>My name is Vincent Chow and I am an undergraduate at Georgia Institute of Technology majoring in \n                  Computer Engineering and minoring in Computer Science.\n                </p>\n                <br/>\n\n                <h1>Where I'm from</h1>\n                <p>I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and have moved around and lived in both Taiwan and Shanghai. \n                  Having this international experience definitely made me more mature, flexible, and adaptable. \n                  Getting to know people from different backgrounds in an early life stage definitely played an \n                  important role in shaping my communication skills and allowed me to understand the importance of \n                  diversity.\n                </p>\n                <br/>\n\n                <h1>My Family</h1>\n                <p>My family has four members.

Due to the lack of infrastructure and trained radiologists, \n                  many illnesses remain undiagnosed or are not detected early enough to avoid long term complications and chronic symptoms.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  The main vision of this research is to use a new approach based on machine learning (ML) and deep \n                  learning (DL) for the classification and detection of interstitial lung disease using thoracic images. \n                  As a major part of the project, the algorithms will be implemented in a mobile application for \n                  smartphone or tablet and will potentially be available as a lightweight web-based application for use \n                  in a web browser.  We utilized Firebase for user authentication, user credential storage, and \n                  profile data. Firebase is a trusted platform used by companies around the world and it allows us to \n                  offer not only a user specific profile but also ensures security for our sensitive data. The backend \n                  API of our app is implemented using a Python library called Flask and communicates via HTTP with our \n                  Azure Machine Learning workspace where our model is contained. \n                </p>\n                <p>\n                The application will also have a platform for radiologists to label thoracic images to add to the \n                database. On the client side, a user would input a X-ray image, or a collection of images, which would \n                be processed and classified in the back-end using the algorithms. This platform will be extremely helpful \n                and innovative, especially for under-developed countries that lack necessary medical infrastructure or \n                access to trained radiologists. The focus of this project will be on the classification of lung disease \n                using CNNs and transfer learning with X-ray images. \n                </p>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>\n                  Developed a Flask API based on a trained model and included features for displaying saliency \n                  map based on the images uploaded.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                  Wrote a user interface front-end using React that calls the Flask API back-end.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                  Utilized Azure and Firebase to store user data and user profile, allowing the user to save their \n                  predicted results and enhanced data protection and usability by 20%.\n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n                <br/>\n                <h1>COVID image classification</h1>\n                <p>\n                With 33.8 million cases worldwide and 7.2 million in the US, accurate and speedy detection of \n                COVID-19 has been a challenge for doctors since the beginning. Although partially effective, \n                traditional COVID-19 tests face imperfections in their results. Our goal with this model would be to \n                develop a machine learning program that could identify high-probability COVID cases based on chest \n                X-rays, allowing medical professionals to potentially see potentially missed COVID cases. This tool \n                could potentially be added to traditional COVID tests in high risk patients, which would help in the \n                successful treatment of these patients. This early detection in particular has led to decreased \n                mortality rates in COVID patients.

In addition to CNNs, \n                 we will utilize Random Forest, an ensemble learning method by constructing and adjusting decision \n                 trees, to discover another approach for our supervised learning.

The basic idea behind FoodShed Project is to \n                  coordinate with local markets to reduce food waste. Normally food that are close to expiration dates \n                  are thrown out, which is wasteful and what we are doing is placing fridges around campus that put \n                  these foods that are close to expiration in for students to take. This on one hand can reduce food \n                  waste and on the other hand help students save some money. What this project will do is to implement \n                  an app that will display where the fridges are around campus, and display pictures of what food are \n                  in the fridges. \n                </p>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>\n                    Developed an app that manages food inventory within the city with AngularJS \n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Utilized Github version control for Integration and development of application \n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Followed Agile practices and gave weekly scrum meetings \n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Successfully planned how to proceed with the FoodShed app development by creating a timeline \n                    chart that lists the time frame for each task, scheduling meetings with another student organization \n                    and preset to them the progresses, and finding tutorials online, resulting in a 25% increase in \n                    productivity. \n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n                <br/>\n\n                <h1>Milk Tank Project</h1>\n                <p>\n                  The milk tank is an indispensable component to a dairy farmer’s business, and is frequently accessed. \n                  It is most common to have the pipe valve controls on top of the milk tank and a ladder to access them. \n                  This has caused problems for farmers who have medical issues that limit their ability to climb a ladder. \n                  The solution to this problem is to create a safer, more stable design that streamlines the client’s access \n                  to the milk tank’s controls and minimizes the need to leave the ground. In meeting the client’s needs the \n                  final product will be unique to farmers with similar issues. \n                </p>\n                <p>\n                In this project we designed, evaluated, and fabricated a device to enable a dairy farmer with prosthetic \n                leg and spina bifida to access the controls of his milk tank with more ease than the status quo. \n                A hydraulic lift with the capacity to support the client was selected, and while it was not purchased, \n                various modifications to the lift were fabricated over the course of the project to be installed on the \n                selected lift once purchased by the client. A railing and gate to ensure the lift’s safety was fabricated \n                using square steel tubing, MIG welding, and low carbon hot rolled flat. Additionally, a steel-and-wood \n                platform was created to mimic the lift’s platform to accommodate the rails. This design should solve the \n                problem of not only our client, but other farmers with similar cases.

I was shocked by the \n                  enormous amount and due to COVID-19, as online shopping becomes more prominent, I decided to open up \n                  my own stores selling decorations through Shopify. The process began with finding products, ordering \n                  them, then to implementing and design the web store.

In this internship I had the opportunity to experience work at multiple departments, from business to \n                  engineering, and to computer science. I gained a deep understanding of the function of each department and further \n                  confirmed my interest lays in the software engineering field. I joined meetings, made presentations and presented \n                  it while in the business department, and actually designed parts and programmed CNC machines in G-code while in \n                  the technical department.
