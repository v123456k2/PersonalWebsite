              <h1>Trulight Project</h1>
                <p>
                Trulight Project is a non-profit start-up dedicated with a mission to protect, all. It is developing 
                mobile apps in Java back-end based on algorithms that determine the user’s safety based on his or her 
                current location and the location’s historical criminal records. On the client side, the user simply 
                just have to open the app and it will provide a score based on where they are. The importance of 
                Trulight Project to the society is without a doubt, crucial making the work I do significant. In this 
                internship, I worked in a team of four implementing the algorithm and conducting extensive research on 
                platforms, languages, and data sources. We utilized Jira for task distribution and had weekly scrum 
                meetings. Below is a list of what I accomplished:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Conducted research and performed cost-benefit analysis on cloud services, which ultimately 
                    led to the successful adoption of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that resulted in cost 
                    reduction by 20% and an increase in productivity by 20%. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Implemented and directed 100+ of unit tests with four team members and provided them with API 
                    documentation for JUnit test, increasing productivity by 30% and project completion status by 5%. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Developed an algorithm in Java to calculate neighborhood safety score (trulight score) for 
                    mobile app backend.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Built Rest API through spring boot and Open API for the algorithm that determine the user’s 
                    safety score, that allowed open-source collaboration, which led to an increase in efficiency by 20%. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Researched reliable sources for each crime category, such as murder and rape, and integrated it to the 
                    algorithm.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Currently, Trulight is partnering with Ayonix to provide drones and cameras for live data feed and 
                  face recognition to compare it to the FBI watch list to further enhance the safety of the society.

                <h1>Lucid-Décor </h1>
                <p>
                  Lucid-Décor is a start-up that I co-founded with a group of friends. The idea spark when I read an 
                  article on the amount of money Americans spend annually on decorative goods. I was shocked by the 
                  enormous amount and due to COVID-19, as online shopping becomes more prominent, I decided to open up 
                  my own stores selling decorations through Shopify. The process began with finding products, ordering 
                  them, then to implementing and design the web store. Below is a list of what I accomplished:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Co-founded Lucid Décor using Node.js backend and Redux framework through React for the online store.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Oversaw the successful alpha launch of our web store and adjusted product mix accordingly.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Integrated purchase checkout flow along with user data encryption through Shopify Partners’ backend.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Developed scalable and efficient restful API backend calls using GraphQL and Apollo.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Global PMX</h1>
                <p>
                  Global PMX is a manufacturing company founded in 1987. It utilizes CNC machines and manufactures 
                  critical components for different products in different industries, ranging from automobiles to medical
                  equipment. In this internship I had the opportunity to experience work at multiple departments, from business to 
                  engineering, and to computer science. I gained a deep understanding of the function of each department and further 
                  confirmed my interest lays in the software engineering field. I joined meetings, made presentations and presented 
                  it while in the business department, and actually designed parts and programmed CNC machines in G-code while in 
                  the technical department. Below is a list of what I accomplished:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Delivered a presentation to the production team on overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) 
                    calculation and maximizing human-computer interaction, increasing productivity by 20%. 
                  </li>
                  <l1>
                    Implemented a more efficient way to cut the materials on Alex Tech-VT08 CNC and Tsugami B0326-II 
                    CNC using G-Code after taking into consideration of the metal shape and knives, increasing profit by 
                    30% and reducing cutting time by 30%. 
                  </l1>
                  <li>
                    Conducted precision tests for finished auto parts with caliper and height gauge.
