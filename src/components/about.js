                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Sky is the limit” is my favorite slogan. As a student who is still in the process of learning technical skills required, this phase is especially crucial for me. I often ponder what it is about software engineering that draws my interests so intensely. Throughout the experiences interning at different companies as well as completing different projects, I have finally found my answer; it is the type of work and the ability to make a difference in people’s lives. I have had experience with many programming projects and internships during my time at school; I felt truly intrigued and invigorated when I was coding.  
                </p>
                <p>I have been involved in many projects and internships. To briefly touch on my experience, in my FoodShed project, I developed an app to monitor fridges around campus in order to reduce food waste. In my previous internship, I was building a mobile app aimed to reduce crime rate by determining the safeness of the user based on their location and historical crime records. Currently, I am in a research team working on the detection of lung diseases using thoracic images, allowing for faster detections.
                </p>
                <p>My specialties include problem solving, quickly learning new skills, and communicating with others. So far, I have experience with Java, Python, C++, C, HTML, CSS, React, SQL, NoSQL, and I’m enthusiastic to apply them in projects and learn more languages.

                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p>My name is Vincent Chow and I am a third-year undergraduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Computer Science.

                <h1>Where I'm from</h1>
                <p>I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and have moved around and lived in both Taiwan and Shanghai. Having this international experience definitely made me more mature, flexible, and adaptable. Getting to know people from different backgrounds in an early life stage definitely played an important role in shaping my communication skills and allowed me to understand the importance of diversity.

                <h1>My Family</h1>
                <p>My family has four members: me, who is the youngest, my older sister who graduated from Emory University and is currently working, my dad who is currently in Shanghai providing for the family, and my mom who takes care of everything in the family.

                <h1>My Interests</h1>
                <p>I love to code. The only thing that limits coding is human imagination, I am free to make what I want and allow my imagination to go wild. I also enjoy seeing the code I wrote being deployed and used by millions of people, improving their lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                I love mountain climbing and biking. I really enjoy these activities especially when I’m with my family. Imagine riding a bike next to the seashore with the wind breezing at you, or climbing the mountain breathing in fresh air and listening to bird chirps. Doesn’t this sound amazing? I like to step into the nature away from the hustle and bustle of big cities, allowing myself to feel calm and peace. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I love to travel. I grew up traveling and fell in love with it. I don’t just travel to travel. I try to make the most of my trips. I especially enjoy seeing the different cultures, understanding their histories, and of course meeting new people.
                </p>

                <h1>My Personality</h1>
                <p>
                I am extremely hardworking and punctual. I put everything into my projects work and I don’t do anything with half effort or half of my heart. I do things in a timely manner; plan out my time accordingly, make sure I am never late, and everything is done on time.
                </p>
                <p>
                I learn from my mistakes. I believe mistakes are opportunities for change as the saying goes, “failure is the mother of success.” Mistakes are the best thing that could happen to me; honestly, it allows me to grow.
                </p>
