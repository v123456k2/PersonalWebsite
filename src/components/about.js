                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>“Sky is the limit”, is my favorite slogan. As a student who is still in the process of 
                  learning technical skills required, this phase is especially crucial for me. I often ponder 
                  what it is about software engineering that draws my interests so intensely. Throughout the 
                  experiences interning at different companies as well as completing different projects, 
                  I have finally found my answer – it is the type of work and the ability to make a difference in 
                  people’s lives. I have had experience with many programming projects and internships during my time 
                  at school, I felt truly intrigued and invigorated when I was coding. 
                </p>
                <p>I have been involved in many projects and internships. To briefly touch on it, in my previous 
                  FoodShed project I developed an app to monitor fridges around campus in order to reduce food waste, 
                  and in my previous internship I was building a mobile app aimed to reduce crime rate by determining 
                  the safeness of the user based on their location and historical crime records.  
                  Currently, I am in a research team working on the detection of lung diseases using thoracic images, 
                  allowing for faster detections.
                </p>
                <p>My specialties include problem solving, quickly learning new skills, and communicating with others. 
                  So far, I have experiences with Java, Python, C++/C, HTML, CSS, React, SQL, NoSQL, 
                  and I’m enthusiastic to apply them in projects and learn more languages.
                </p>

                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p>My name is Vincent Chow and I am an undergraduate at Georgia Institute of Technology majoring in 
                  Computer Engineering and minoring in Computer Science.

                <h1>Where I'm from</h1>
                <p>I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and have moved around and lived in both Taiwan and Shanghai. 
                  Having this international experience definitely made me more mature, flexible, and adaptable. 
                  Getting to know people from different backgrounds in an early life stage definitely played an 
                  important role in shaping my communication skills and allowed me to understand the importance of 
                  diversity.

                <h1>My Interests</h1>
                <p>I love to code. The only thing that limits coding is human imagination, I am free to make what 
                  I want and allow my imagination to go wild. I also enjoy seeing the code I wrote being deployed and 
                  used by millions of people, improving their lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                I love mountain climbing and biking. I really enjoy these activities especially when I’m with my family. 
                Imagine riding a bike next to the seashore with the wind breezing at you, or climbing the mountain breathing in 
                fresh air and listening to bird chirps. Doesn’t this sound amazing? I like to step into the nature away from 
                the hustle and bustle of big cities, allowing myself to feel calm and peace. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I love to travel. I grew up travelling and fell in love with it. I don’t just travel to travel. 
                  I try to make the most of my trips. I especially enjoy seeing the different cultures, understanding 
                  their histories, and of course meeting new people.
                </p>

                  do anything with half effort or half my heart. I am also always punctual, I do things in a timely manner,
                  plan out my time accordingly and make sure I am never late and everything is done on time.

                  I learn from my mistakes. I believe mistakes are opportunities for change as the saying goes,
